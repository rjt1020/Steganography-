STEGANOGRAPHY (A technique to hide any information within an image file.)
******************************************************************************

This project is developed for hiding information in any image file. The scope of the project is implementation of steganography tools for hiding information which includes any type of information file and image files and the path where the user wants to save Image and extracted file.
This technique is chosen, because this system includes not only imperceptibility but also un-delectability by any steganolysis tool.
Also this application is designed in such a way that when the user encrypts a file he gets an option for securing that encrypted file with his chosen password. The same password is needed whenever the decryption of the file is to be done.
Methodology:
User needs to run the application. The user has two tab options â€“ encrypt and decrypt. If user select encrypt, application gives the screen to select image file, information file and option to save the image file. If the user selects decrypt, application gives the screen to select only image file and ask path where user want to save the secret file.
Encryption and Decryption both needs a password if the user wants.
